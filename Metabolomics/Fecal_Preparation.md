#Fecal Preparation for Metabolomics 
_Last updated: 1/6/16_


_Note that input material amounts differ between fecal samples from mice and humans. We require about 20mg (half a pellet; I have had great results in some cases with as low as 5mg) of mouse feces, vs 100mg of human feces._ 
 
__Fecal samples should be stored at -80C. While processing, samples keep samples on ice as much as possible during all steps.__ 
 
1. Transfer weighed fecal sample (see above) to a 2ml screw-cap with autoclaved and acid-washed 0.1um Zirconia beads 
  * 100ul of beads is reasonable, may need to adjust depending on amount of fecal material transferring but not so much that you cannot aspirate the solvent 
2. Add 100ul acidified ddH2O (0.01% FA), 100ul ACN 
3. Bead-beat for 4 minutes on high at 4C 
4. Centrifuge 9x1000 rcf for 10 minutes at 4C 
5. Aspirate 50ul of supernatant, careful to avoid beads 
6. Add 425ul ddH2O, 25ul FA and briefly vortex 
7. Filter sample using prepared filters (see below) 
  * Be careful not to over-pressurize the filters, you only require a few uls as in most cases this stock sample will be further diluted, and only 2ul are injected on the LCMS. 
8. Store at -80C 
  * Stock samples are now suspended in 5% ACN / 5% FA 
  * Dilute samples further for direct LCMS injection from 1:5-1:100 using ACN:FA:ddH2O (5:5:90) 
    Note: I will typically prepare the working samples at 1:100 and inject those, but if signal is low I will follow up with higher concentrations 
 
 
##Filter preparation 
Filters: 13mm Fisherbrand 0.22um filters (Cat: 09-720-3) 
Syringes: 1ml BD TB syringe (Ref: 309624) 
 
Unwashed filters will contaminate the samples. In order to clean the filters, __elute and discard 1ml of MeOH 2x using a syringe plunger.__
