These tips pertain to the [Centrifugation Protocol](https://mobio.com/media/wysiwyg/pdfs/protocols/12955.pdf) for the MoBio PowerSoil 96 Well DNA Isolation Kit.
Thanks to Nicole Davis from the Relman Lab for a lot of these tips.

### General Tips before Beginning
Make sure to leave some (4+) wells empty as controls!
Diagonal patterns are easy to remember: e.g. B2-C3-D4-E5-F6. I shift this diagonal pattern over by one well for each subsequent plate, which gives me an easy way to keep track of plates.)

Keep track of how your plates are oriented (ie, where A1 is).  For some baffling reason, the various types of plates do not have the bevel/cut corner on the same corner.  This will be important for steps 20-21 when you have to load from your plates multiple times, but also for the final step when you collect your DNA.

Centrifuge tape (fabric-like, used to cover the spin filter plates) and sealing tape (shiny, used to cover the other plates) are not the same.

**Do not throw away the square well mat.** Without it, the wells will not seal properly seal during beadbeating. When loading samples, store this mat so that it won’t get contaminated with exogenous DNA (e.g. wrap in ethanol-cleaned foil). Do not freeze (apparently the Relman group experienced issues with doing this).

### Protocol for Loading Samples
1. First spin down the bead plates that you are going to load.  This will help the beads not stick to the mat as you are pulling them off. If you don't do this, sometimes the beads get wedged between the wells, which can be a problem when you bead beat.
**Note**: If *any* of the wells on the square mats have beads poking through the mat, call MoBio and get a replacement for free. I have tried to use these defective mats before; during beadbeating they sometimes spring a leak where the bead is poking through.
2. Take the square well mat off and store it somewhere clean. I wrap it in aluminum foil that I have ethanol-ed.
3. If you are loading samples using an inoculating loop and are going to continue processing right after you finish loading, you can preload the 750 ul of bead solution before loading your poops. This will make it easier to dislodge poops into each well.  Otherwise, skip this step.
4. Take your PowerSoil Bead Plate and cover it with a sheet of sticky foil tape.  Press down enough that you *barely* impress the lines of the wells on the foil (preventing well-to-well contamination), but don't press down too hard or else it will be really hard to remove the foil.  If you don't want to use foil tape, we have also found that wrapping the top with a piece of aluminum foil (tightly taped on all sides) works great, too.
5. Before loading a sample, punch the foil over that well with a clean 1000ul pipette tip. Load the sample with a 1ul loop and twirl the loop in the garnet beads/rocks to dislodge the sample.  For samples that were too liquidy, use bucconal swabs, and cut them through so that the tip does not stick out of the well.
**Note**: If you are willing to part with an entire fecal pellet or to use swabs, you could technically add samples to your plates during your experiment, and to store these plates in the -80. In this situation though, you would not want to add bead solution to your plate.
6. After loading a sample, cover the hole in the foil with a circular cryolabel to prevent further contamination of that well.  When you are done loading all of the samples, just take the foil off and replace with a new foil label until you're ready to process. **Tip**: Before removing the foil, perform a quick spin.
7. Store your plate in -20 or -80.  Regardless of where you store it, you must thaw your samples before adding C1, which contains SDS, because it will precipitate out if your plates and buffer are cold.  I usually take my plates from the -80 and leave them at room temperature for half an hour to an hour, but if your samples are being stored at -20, you can wait for a shorter amount of time.


### Tips for DNA Isolation (TL;DR: pre-aliquot your buffers into plates)
**Note**: The step numbers refer to the Detailed User Centrifugation Protocol

**Do not use foil tape to seal your samples in the beadbeater.** Your samples will leak. Instead, save the square well mat in a safe place, then re-seal the plate with the square well mat prior to loading into the beadbeater.

In steps 9-10, after bead beating, you will transfer the supernatant to a clean 1ml collection plate and then add 250 ul of C2.  To prevent cross contamination and to speed things up, you should pre-aliquot the 250 ul of C2 to this 1ml collection plate and then add your supernatant to the plate.

In steps 12-13, you will transfer supernatant to a new 1ml collection plate and then add 200 ul of C3.  Just like before, we would recommend pre-aliquoting the 200 ul of C3 into the 1ml collection plate.

In step 14, you will do one final pelleting in a 1ml collection plate.  2ml collection plates are best to be used at this step instead of 1ml ones because they have a lip at the bottom so that it’s easy to aspirate without disturbing the pellet. The protocol specifies a 1ml collection plate, but there are actually enough extra 2 ml plates for you to use a 2 ml plate at this step.

In steps 16-19, you will transfer your supernatant to a 2ml collection plate and then add and mix 650 ul C4 TWICE. We pre-aliquoted 1300 ul of C4 into the 2ml collection plate and then transferred and mixed the supernatant into the 1300 ul.  Then, using the same tips, directly transfer 650 ul from the mix onto the spin filters (step 21).

**Do not use Elution Sealing Mats in the final step after eluting your DNA.** They were created by the Devil himself to tempt you but they will lead you down a path to [much ruination](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/168971/). Not only are they hard to put on, they’re really hard to take off without spraying your samples everywhere.  Just use the foil tape to seal your DNA products.
